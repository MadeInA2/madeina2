			h2 All Hands Active
			p Makers gather here at the AHA! Shop. We take our world and play with it like legos. Mixing and matching recipes of life like a top chef with a picky client. A dash of electronics, a pinch of art, a scoop of biology and a MONSTER amount of awesome! All Hands Active is a 501(c)(3) non-profit community organization. We want to make Ann Arbor smarter, and this is good for everyone!
